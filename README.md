 This is a repository containing codes of UCD at HashCode 2020

#### [Practice-V1](practice/v1.py): First version on hashcode pratice
- The method we used is exhaustive
- Hence, the complexity is very. For example, for the medium sample, it takes 2e50 times of research, that is unrealistic for the actual problem
- We need to consider optimization solutions

### [Practice-V2](practice/v2.py): Second version on hashcode pratice
- We first shuffle the original slices type list 10000 times with different random seeds
- Then apply the maximum sum segment algorithm
- Finally We achieve a total score of 1,505,004,615 on Hashcode [Judge System](https://hashcodejudge.withgoogle.com/)
- This result is very promising.
